          This is the introduction to my test website. The intention of this part of learning is to get comfortable with formatting a good looking page. In the following text there'll be more about that, which is pretty regular behaviour given that this intro text will be followed by some content. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Following on from the above, it's now time that we dive into some topical description. So, given that, here we are, we've arrived. There's no more proof required than your very eyes to the fact that we're now reading a paragraph that's beyond the intro passage. So, generally some nitty gritty is expected here, so let's get into it. 
        </p>
        <h2>Moving on</h2> 
        <p>
          For want of something more relevant, there's simply text here but some meaning is reachable and so here it follows. A nice block of text looks good to the eye, and generally we're used to seeing some nice chunky paragraphs. That's the expectation if it's a blog article that's got some depth. However, it is possible (if rare), to see blog articles that are pretty short. If there was such a thing, maybe it would look a bit like this. But let's not finish it right there, a little more guff would be great to fill this out, but will that happen, or will this sample literally stay this long only. Of course sometimes I reflect on whether someone would actually look at my git project.

          This website doesn't have too much to say obviously, but by now you might recofnise that this section is what you might see at the side here.

          It's really just a try-out
